     * Mistral AI provides the ability to stream responses back to a client in order to allow partial results for certain requests. Tokens will be sent as data-only server-sent events as they become available, with the stream terminated by a data: [DONE] message. Otherwise, the server will hold the request open until the timeout or until completion, with the response containing the full result as JSON.
